## Problems

### Problem# 1

An unexplainable break-in at a bank gets attention when one of the major lockers for cash is found with its door wide open - however, "no cash seems to be stolen". The break-in seems to happen either at evening or before evening. Of course, the bank is a high profile location for security, with frequent security audits and measures in place, so this is a measure breach and police is called immediately.

The peculiar case attracts Sherlock Holmes to investigate the weird circumstances. A bank safe open, with no cash stolen, what is the criminal trying to do? No employee was authorized to open the safe that day, and only certain employees are authorized to visit the rooms where the lockers are. Of course, the first approach Sherlock takes is to examine the evidence to remove weak suspects. Sherlock asks The Bank to provide access to the cameras, so to see who has gone near the lockers.

He finds the answer is no one. All the video records of that day show no one going by the safe, only it being open suddenly after a time period, "2:33:30 PM", whereas at "2:33:29 PM", the locker was closed. This indicates a temper into the data records of The Bank itself.

The Bank panics, its security has been breached without it knowing. Sherlock and Watson check out the video records again. There is a random folder in their data entries called "invitation", which contains two files, "hello.txt", and "video.mp4". "hello.txt" says the following,

"Hello. We are looking for highly intelligent individuals. To find them, we have devised a test.

There is a message hidden in this folder.

Find it, and it will lead you on the road to finding us. We look forward to meeting the few that will make it all the way through.

Good luck.

0307"

Sherlock opens up the "video.mp4", but it is corrupted - it won't open! Watson comes up with the idea of opening the file in a text editor. Doing so reveals the following random characters,

Cracking the code at the center may lead to the next clue, but how? And what is the criminal trying to do? Also what does "MARUS PRIMEVAL" mean - maybe it is some encoding of a name of the person who did this, maybe they work at the bank?

### Problem# 2

The next day Sherlock and Watson receive a letter passed through under their door of the office. It is again a piece of paper with a matrix of scrambled letters. It is their next clue. The content is as follows,

"Index the key, arrange the columns, find the location, meet us tomorrow

S L K V G Q H L U I

- O W T T Y N E W T
C O L B H S C E P G
N I H C R A A K 6 K
I N U L N A O I T A
C F O Y I T S R E V
D N A R T E U P M O
C S G N G I R E M E
T S A F E S C N E I
S U P M C A Y T I C
T R O F E Y K E H T
H P I C X T E N E H
A L Q K G A S I R E
"
Seems like the cipher contains a location, but is there any more information hidden here?
Problem# 3

After decrypting the location, Sherlock and Watson reach there quickly only to find it closed today. They quickly ask authorities to arrive and investigate the venue to find more clues. On the 1st floor, they find a small kitchen, with a note stuck to the wall with duct tape. On it, reads the following string.

"IOXWCAZUVQEIUNC EY HGVSDR MGDO YE SU FKH. HE GRO 0307. CE KHP RKSZEYSOBVU QOX TRU MRKAU YY AZ BKDV. WK DY DZT ROVER ROOCU PNJS. WHD EBA SI CEYPYDDIHLO VZR ZHO CTSNAZ QE TNE LQYK.

Sherlock is pretty sure it can be decrypted with the answer in the last puzzle they found at their office. Maybe it finally leads to the culprit. One way of solving this is perhaps corresponding each character in the encrypted string with the numerical index of the “answer” found earlier, performing a numerical operation with the answer and the encrypted string to get back the original string? But who knows, it can be anything.

## Solutions

### Problem# 1

So the sequence is of the greatest importance here. Using the sequence, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 …, the below string can be encrypted by moving the character 2 characters ahead in the alphabet. The algorithm looks like this,

- ‘A’ -> 2 characters right shift -> ‘C’
- ‘m’ -> 4 character right shift -> ‘q’
- ‘o’ -> 6 characters right shift -> ‘u’

If the character sequence surpasses ‘z’, repeat from ‘a’.

The encrypted string is therefore,

“Cquvq mem eq qrk yr kk. Diph wxq ex qq, jovn obd kd ww. Dts cyu tq zpo bupn nubdrm ug XLECNFWNQZ - diki cx brq dmgxcru un fvu inbet.”

And the decrypted string is,

"Among you is one of us. Find one of us, find all of us. The key to the next puzzle is FRIENDSHIP - look at the numbers of the order."

As a bonus, the “MARUS PRIMEVAL” contains the name of the person who performed the “Break In” at the bank. Take the odd characters from the first name, thus ‘MRS’, then notice the name in the last name, ‘EVA’, thus ‘MRS EVA’ was responsible.

### Problem # 2

A columnar shift, I = 0, U = 1, L = 2, H = 3, Q = 4, …

Below is the answer. Read each line, except the first line, from left to right, and put it together in a string, which spells out a sentence, location, and key for the next problem.

I U L H Q G V K L S

T W E N T Y T W O -
G P E C H S B L O C
K 6 K A R A C H I N
A T I O N A L U N I
V E R S I T Y O F C
O M P U T E R A N D
E M E R G I N G S C
I E N C E S F A S T
C I T Y C A M P U S
T H E K E Y F O R T
H E N E X T C I P H
E R I S G A K Q L A

The encrypted string is,

“S L K V G Q H L U I

- O W T T Y N E W T
C O L B H S C E P G
N I H C R A A K 6 K
I N U L N A O I T A
C F O Y I T S R E V
D N A R T E U P M O
C S G N G I R E M E
T S A F E S C N E I
S U P M C A Y T I C
T R O F E Y K E H T
H P I C X T E N E H
A L Q K G A S I R E”

Just correctly set the order of the columns to get back the proper sentence.

Needless to say, you can also get the right output by reading it right to left (easiness for competition’s sake).

### Problem# 3

Using the key, take the first character of the key, subtract the difference of the first character of the key and the first character of the encrypted string, to get back the first character of the decrypted string. If the characters of the key run out, start again from the first index.

"CONGRATULATIONS ON HAVING MADE IT SO FAR. WE ARE 0307. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BREAK IN AT BANK. WE DO NOT PREFER LOOSE ENDS. MRS EVA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISHAP AT THE BANK. WE HAVE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE BANK'S BACKUP DATA. A BANK WE BELIEVE TO BE CORRUPT, AIDING IN MONEY LAUNDERING. WE SHALL MEET AGAIN SOON. 0307."
